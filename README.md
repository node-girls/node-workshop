# Node.js CMS workshop

## What?

Build your own Node.js project

Today you'll be building your very own platform to write blog posts. You will be able to write blog posts and save them.

This is often referred to as a **content management system** (CMS).

This is an adaptation of a [tutorial](https://github.com/node-girls/node-workshop) created by [Node Girls](http://nodegirls.io). Some of this tutorial will be repetition from this morning's code-a-long or a variation of steps covered in the code-a-long. There are often several ways to accomplish something in coding, so everything here may not be exactly the same - that's good! Feel free to reflect on any differences and ask questions. At the end of the tutorial, there are optional stretch goals to introduce more advanced concepts.

## Why?

We believe in learning by doing!

## How?

### Structure of the workshop

You will be working on this project in pairs.  Your mentors will be available to help you out and answer any questions. Remember the 20/20/20 rule if you get stuck!

**First, clone this repository onto your own machine**

The project has been split into steps, which are documented in separate files here on the master branch. Each step builds progressively on top of the previous step. 

### Keywords and jargon

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough.  Try to resist the urge to copy and paste - you will learn **much** more if you get into the habit of typing things out.

You might want to test out small bits of code and run them before adding it to your project.  For this, you can use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) if you like.

Throughout each step, we have **bolded** any jargon that you may or may not be familiar with.  At the bottom, you'll find a *keywords* section, some of them with links to further explanations.  

There is also a link to the general Node Girls cheatsheet under Useful links at the end of this README.

Remember to ask the mentors any questions you have as they arise.
